!!! Re-running these utility scripts after modifying config.env is not supported
    You'd need to backup config.env, delete k8/ directory and start over

    The purpose of these shell scripts is to help you quickly spin-up a dev, test or demo instance of IGA
    For other deployments you must use Kustomize artifacts directly by authoring necessary layers
    This script also serves as technical reference for creating those layers
